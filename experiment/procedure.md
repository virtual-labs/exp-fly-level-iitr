## Procedure<br>

<div style="text-align:justify;">

To perform the experiment:  
  
1.  Connect the circuit as shown in the figure 1 using LED.
2.  Apply the supply voltage from DC regulated power supply (V<sub>in</sub>) from 0V to 10V.
3.  Tabulate the readings by measuring the the voltage (V<sub>f</sub>) across the diode and current (I<sub>f</sub>) through the diode for diffrent steps of applied voltage (V<sub>in</sub>).
4.  Plot a graph between the voltage across the diode (V<sub>f</sub>) and current passing through the diode (I<sub>f</sub>).
<!-- 5.  Draw the graph between Forward Voltage (V<sub>f</sub>) and Forward Current (I<sub>f</sub>).-->
